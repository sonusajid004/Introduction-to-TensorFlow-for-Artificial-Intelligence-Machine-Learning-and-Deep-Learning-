This is a 4 week course where you will be introduced to Keras and use it to implement different models and learn about different callbacks.

Learnt the following concepts:

Week1: Working with Google Colab,Introduction to Keras that uses Tensorflow as backend

Week2: Working with MNIST Dataset using ANNs,using callbacks to control training of neural network

Week3: Working with MNIST Dataset using CNNs

Week4: Working with complex Datasets
